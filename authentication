## Authentication API Overview
All requests to the API need to be accompanied by an authorization header with an authentication token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer 212LJ3k0i2382364HIUEjfeJB98yvH
```
Authentication tokens are generated via the authentication endpoint and expire within 1 hour. They need to be then regenerated. If youâ€™re using our JavaScript SDK, this is automatically handled for you.

There are two main token types available for use within your store client_credentials and implicit. The implicit token is the more limited of the two, restricting access to mostly read-only, whereas client credential token has full read and write access.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :-----------|:-------|:-------------|
| `expires` | `timestamp` | The epoch time that this token expires at. |
| `identifier` |	`string` |	The type of token requested. This can be a client_credentials or implicit. |
| `expires_in` |	`integer` |	The duration in seconds after which the token expires. |
| `access_token` |	`string` |	The access token you use for subsequent authenticated requests to the API. |
| `token_type`| `string` |	Right now this is only Bearer. |

## Sample Response

```json
{
  "expires": 1500638876,
  "identifier": "client_credentials",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "xa3521ca621113e44eeed9232fa3e54571cb08bc",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

## Client Credentials vs. Implicit Use Case Scenarios

Typically, you would use the implicit authentication method for client-side browser based applications (i.e. frontend), and client credentials for all administrative tasks (CRUD) you need to perform at the backend.

## Account Authentication

You can also generate account tokens to authenticate account members (shoppers) with one of many available authentication methods. You must use account management authentication token with the implicit token to access orders or account APIs. Using the tokens, you can create and filter orders and addresses.

## Customer Authentication

You can also generate customer tokens to authenticate the customers with single sign-on, or email address and password. You must use customer token with the implicit token to access orders or customer APIs. Using the tokens, you can create and filter orders and addresses.
