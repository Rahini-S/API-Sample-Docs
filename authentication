## Authentication API Overview
All requests to the API need to be accompanied by an authorization header with an authentication token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer 212LJ3k0i2382364HIUEjfeJB98yvH
```
Authentication tokens are generated via the authentication endpoint and expire within 1 hour. They need to be then regenerated. If youâ€™re using our JavaScript SDK, this is automatically handled for you.

There are two main token types available for use within your store client_credentials and implicit. The implicit token is the more limited of the two, restricting access to mostly read-only, whereas client credential token has full read and write access.
